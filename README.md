# PNGtoGraph
A java program that can turn a png image (should be quite small, like 20x20 pixels max)
into a .grf file for the plotting program Graph https://www.padowan.dk/
Due to my lazyness, the image must first be rotated 90 degrees to the right. (You can look at the code to know why :)


This can be useful for students with the home task of making art with a plotting program, like I had to.
I handed in a pixelated version of Mona Lisa and got an A+
